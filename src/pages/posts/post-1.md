# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2026-01-20

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning to use the Astro framework.

## What I've accomplished so far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, i created a new Astro project using npm create astro@latest, then i created my index, about and blog pages and made buttons to link them all together.

2. **Connecting Online Services**: I connected my VSCode to github, published my project to a Github repository, then connected Netlify to my Github account and let Netlify build and deploy the website.

3. **Making My First Blog Post**: Thats what your reading right now, my first blog post on my wensite, i created it using a Markdown file.

## What's Next?

I will continue working on my website and add more posts as a progress.
